<b>Version 2.0</b>

Made Compatible with THunderbird 68. FiltaQuilla had to be largely rewritten for Thunderbird 68, with substantial help from <a href="https://github.com/ptomulik" target="_blank">Paweł Tomulik</a>.

Going forward most bugfixes / new features will be exclusively available for Thunderbird 68. The reason for this is that through architectural changes on the Mozilla code platform the code for Thunderbird 60 and earlier is substantially different.

As I am often asked about added features for filter conditions and actions for my Add-on <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quickfilters/">quickFilters</a> this is a good location for extending Filter behavior.

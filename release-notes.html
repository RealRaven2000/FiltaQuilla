<b>Version 3.7.2</b>

FiltaQuilla is now compatible with Thunderbird 112. FiltaQuilla had to have some necessary changes for Thunderbird 102, especially custom search terms and actions could not be edited anymore. If you find any new problems, related to the update to ESR102, please report them at <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/issues"> the FiltaQuilla issue tracker</a>


I will try to keep the latest version on ATN compatible with both Thunderbird 91 and 102 as long as possible.

All new development for Thunderbird 115 will be published in as new branch of FiltaQuilla code, starting with a new major version number 4.*. See <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/issues/223">[issue 223]</a> (Make FiltaQuilla compatible with Thunderbird 115).

<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/issues/219">[issue 216]</a> Allow special characters in file name, e.g. German Umlauts. So far most special characters in saved messages and attachments were automatially converted to phonetically similar ASCII characters to avoid file errors. You can now re-add letters that you want to preserve and you know that they work on your file system.

This is achieved via a whitelist, which you can now enter on the actions tab.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Support My Work</strong>

As I am often asked about added features for filter conditions and actions for my Add-on <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quickfilters/">quickFilters</a> - FiltaQuilla is a better location for extending Filter behavior - specifically adding new types of Actions and Conditions.

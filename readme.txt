# FiltaQuilla
Adds many new mail filter actions - launch a file, suppress notification, remove star or tag, mark replied or unread, copy as "read", append text to subject.

This Add-on is adopted from its previous author & creator R. Kent James who
had to retire form Add-on development. As I am often asked about added features
for filter conditions and actions for my Add-on quickFilters this is a good
container for this additional functionality. I am keeping the license as GPL 3.0 for now.
